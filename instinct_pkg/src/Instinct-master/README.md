# Instinct Planner

The Instinct Planner is a biologically inspired Reactive Planner based on the original POSH Planner created by Dr Joanna Bryson. It is written in C++ and is optimised to have a tiny memory footprint, making it suitable for embedded controllers and multi-agent systems.

This library works with both Arduino and Microsoft Visual C++ environments. This libary is required as part of the [R5 Robot].

For full details see [Instinct Planner] page on the [my web site].
